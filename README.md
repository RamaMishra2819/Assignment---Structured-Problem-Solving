# Assignment-Structured Problem Solving

In this assignment based on the structured problem solving using frameworks, you will be tested on applying the following frameworks on 4 different case studies:

* 5 WHYs
* 5 Ws
* SPIN Selling Framework
* Issue Tree Framework
* 7Ps Framework
In this assignment, we will test your understanding of applying some concepts from the frameworks mentioned above with the help of the following case studies. 

Structured problem solving is often a broad topic and people might work in slightly different ways while trying to do a root cause analysis. However, to avoid any ambiguous answers, we have kept the case studies extremely straight forward and to the point. 

In the case study 1 where you will be asked to find the possible root causes, it is possible you frame your sentences in different ways or justify your answer in different ways. But the final underlying intention for that root cause and that justification remains the same and you will be awarded marks if that is correct.

In case study 2, again you will be asked to fill missing pieces in a conversation by filling in the blank questions. 
In Case study 4 asks to fill some type of questions that you will ask while trying to understand a business operation. Again, if the final underlying intention for that root cause and that justification are correct, no matter how you have phrased the question, you will be awarded marks.

For case study 3, you will understand once you read the problem statement that ambiguous answers are anyways not possible and the answer for every question asked there will be to the point.

### Case Study 1: Problem Statement
Imagine you are in 1977 and you work as an air crash investigation officer on the Spanish island of Tenerife. You receive some bad news that two Boeing 747 passenger jets, KLM Flight 4805 and Pan Am Flight 1736, collided on the runway in the airport, which has resulted in the death of 583 people.
You have been tasked with investigating this incident to find the possible root causes for the crash.

You are a Big Data Tools and Technologies sales consultant, working for a company, Complex Data. Complex Data recently released the latest version of its Big Data tool, Data Fire, which helps companies analyse data and generate insights rapidly.
At a conference, you meet the Head of the Data Analytics team of a famous retail chain, Home Universe, during the networking session. You strike up a conversation and realize that the Home Universe is using tools and technologies that are not serving their needs; specifically, they are using Data Churn to analyse data and generate insights. The Data Analytics team has to respond to requests for insights, reports and dashboards from different departments in the Home Universe. Given that these requests are for addressing urgent business needs, the team is usually under time pressure and faces a heavy workload.
You know that Data Churn is not only outdated but is also very slow and difficult to use compared with Data Fire, which is a state-of-the-art, easy-to-use solution with rapid response times; however, from a cost perspective, Data Churn costs significantly less than Data Fire.
Instead of jumping directly into pitching Data Fire to the Head of Data Analytics for Home Universe, your job now is to build the implications of using Data Churn so that the overall costs are reflected as much higher than in the case of Data Fire.
Based on this information, your task is to complete the blank spaces "-----" with suitable questions that the complex data team could ask the team of Home Universe during that part in the conversation in the attached word file given below. You can refer to the answers mentioned by the Home Universe team to get an understanding of what questions the Complex Data team could ask at that point in the conversation. Fill in the banks as the questions you feel the

### Case Study 4: Problem Statement
WalStore, a supermarket chain, has successfully grown from a few stores in just one city in the U.S. to over a hundred stores spread across 10 cities. As they are gearing up for the next wave of expansion to become a nationwide supermarket chain, they want to optimise their operations in order to ensure cost efficiencies. They have engaged a leading consulting firm, McBride & Co., to make recommendations about how WalStore’s end-to-end operations can be optimised.
In Phase 1, the McBride consultants plan to spend a couple of weeks gathering facts and data about WalStore’s operations. McBride & Co. already have a guide on supermarket operations from earlier assignments with other clients. Following is an extract from the guide, describing the various operational steps for any supermarket.
Your task for this question is to go through the extract below and then use the 5W+H framework to come up with a list of questions that will help McBride & Co. gather relevant facts and data about WalsStore’s current state of operations.
“McBride’s Guide To Supermarket Operations”
Six major entities are involved in the end-to-end operations for any supermarket. These entities are described as follows:
--> Suppliers: They produce goods that are to be sold in the supermarket. It should be noted that supermarkets do not produce goods themselves. They are in the service of retailing goods produced by suppliers. Depending upon the type of supermarket and their customer needs, a supermarket can have either a concentrated set of suppliers or a much diverse set of suppliers.
--> Warehouse transporters: They move the goods produced by suppliers to the concerned supermarket’s warehouses.
--> Warehouses: This is where goods that are produced by suppliers are stocked for further distribution. The locations of these warehouses, their size, operations (robotised or manual), etc. are thoroughly investigated.
--> Warehouse-to-store transporters: These transporters move the goods stocked in the warehouses to the stores where they are sold to customers.
--> Stores: Stores receive goods from transporters and stock them in their buffer supply area, from where they replenish the stock on the supermarket shelves.
--> Customers: Customers visit the stores, examine the goods stocked on the shelves and make the final purchase as per their needs.
The six entities mentioned above undertake steps, as depicted pictorially below, to make the goods produced by suppliers available to customers in stores.
Flow of the Operations between the 6 entities
Understand the scenario given above and in the document below a table is given. It consists of some sample questions and some spaces with “-------” in each question for the 6 entities given below. You have to fill these spaces with suitable questions that you think is a valid question for each of What, How, Who, When, Where? interrogation for each of the 6 operations of the WalStore i.e.
Supplier
Warehouse transporter
Warehouse
Warehouse-to-store transporter
Store
Customer
